# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
A recursive function is a function that calls itself. There are two cases that a recursive function may have: a Base Case and a Recursive Case. A Base case is what stops the function from continuing to call itself recursively and a Recursive Case case is where the function calls itself recursively.
